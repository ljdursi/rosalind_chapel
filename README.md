# Rosalind in Chapel

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ljdursi/rosalind_chapel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ljdursi/rosalind_chapel)

Slowly implementing the [Rosalind problems](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/),
a very nice set of simple, pedagogical intro-to-bioinformatics problems, in python and
Chapel to compare the two.

(If you're planning on working through the problems yourself, don't cheat yourself by looking
at these and other answers!)
